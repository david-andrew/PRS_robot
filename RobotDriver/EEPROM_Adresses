Data stored in EEPROM on arduino (decimal addresses):
0    LASER_ALIGNMENT_OFFSET (int32_t)
4    GLUE_ALIGNMENT_OFFSET (int32_t)
8    PRESS_ALIGNMENT_OFFSET (int32_t)
12   SCALE_DEAD_WEIGHT (float) (i.e. 4 bytes)


Current Saved values:
LASER_ALIGNMENT_OFFSET = -52
GLUE_ALIGNMENT_OFFSET = 4110
PRESS_ALIGNMENT_OFFSET = 13432
SCALE_DEAD_WEIGHT = 1441.83


Potential future implementations
SLOT_BATCH_SIZE (uint8_t)
glue arm limits, arc size, etc. (int32_t)
others?
